# Demantive Growth Blueprint

> **Business as Code**: The foundational repository defining Demantive's operational DNA, service offerings, and systematic approach to B2B growth marketing.

## What is Demantive?

Demantive is a lean, AI-enabled marketing consultancy built for the modern B2B landscape. We are a core team of 3 highly skilled professionals who leverage artificial intelligence to deliver outsized impact for our clients through systematic, data-driven growth strategies.

## Philosophy: Business as Code

This repository embodies our "business as code" philosophy - treating our operational knowledge, processes, and methodologies as versioned, collaborative, and systematically managed assets. Just as software engineers use code repositories to build products, we use this repository to build and evolve our business.

### Why Business as Code?

- **Transparency**: Every aspect of our service delivery is documented and accessible
- **Collaboration**: Our team can collectively iterate on methodologies and processes  
- **Consistency**: Standardized approaches ensure quality across all client engagements
- **Scalability**: Systematic processes enable us to grow without losing quality
- **AI Integration**: Structured data enables our AI tools to provide better context and recommendations

## Repository Structure
